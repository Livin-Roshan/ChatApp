# in_chat_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

In this Project I have used Zego Cloud to create an In Chat App.
By importing the Zego Cloud packages and entering the App Id which is registered in the Zego Cloud official website the App is developed.

By Signing in with Email and password new id is created for chatting and using the id name we can chat with different peoples who signed in with other id.
